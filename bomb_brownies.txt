Brooke's Best Bombshell Brownies

Ingredients

1 cup butter, melted
3 cups white sugar
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup semisweet chocolate chips


Step 1
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Light grease a 9x13 baking dish.

Step 2
Combine the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl.  Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each, until thoroughly blended.

Step 3
Sift the flour, cocoa powder, and salt in a bowl.  Gradually stir flour mixture into the egg mixture until blended.  Stir in the chocolate morsels.  Spread the batter evenly into the prepared baking dish.

Step 4
Bake in a preheated oven until an inserted toothpick comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes.  Remove, and cool pan on wire rack before cutting.
